# BankTrasfer
## Purpose
This program Is a utility program to basically send money to anyone registered
You have to register your card to recieve but you do not have to to send.

## What I have
### BankTransferTextBased
I tried and failed so much for so long, I decided to take baby steps and make the program textbased.
Minimum requirenments is T3 case, T3 APU, T3 Datacard, Internte card, Wireless network card, T3 Ram,
HDD, EEPROM.

If you don't keep the internet card in the device, you can Use a T2 GFX card and cpu

Make sure to follow the proper steps in connecting this to the bank system.

### BankTransfer
The unfinished and not working version
This is dependant on libCB and bank_api

## To do
make gui version
