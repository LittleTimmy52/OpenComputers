# Cryption
## Purpose
This simply is to encrypt or decrypt any single file with the best encryption allowed by the data card installed.

## What I have
### CryptionT2
This program can encrypt and decrypt with aes-128 and needs a T2 data card

CryptionT2 \<option: key, encrypt, decrypt, clear, help> \<option: path>

### CryptionT1
This program encodes rather than encrypts, but its the best the T1 data card can do

CryptionT1 \<option: encrypt, decrypt, clear, help> \<option: path>

### Cryption
This program is a combination of the 2 tiers and will encrypt accordingly based on the tier.

Cryption \<option: key, encrypt, decrypt, clear, help> \<option: path>

### CryptionPlus
This program incorperates TrashZip to encrypt not only files, but folders as well.

CryptionPlus \<option: key, encrypt, decrypt, clear, help> \<option: path>

## To do
MineOS port?
