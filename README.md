# OpenComputers
## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to simply host my code and projects for oprncomputers

## What I have

### ServerFS
This is my wip conversion at converting an existing serverFS to us GERTi

### NetworkRelay
This relays wireless messages over long distannces via linked cards. The 2 relay computers need a linked and wireless network card, 
the computer takes wireless messages, serializes the data, sends it over the linked card to the other which then broadcasts it over
the wireless card. 

wireless message <-> linked message <-> linked message <-> wireless message

### Address to file
This saves all components to a file, the other script inserts a specified component address into a specified script at the top

### Security
This is a collection of my basic security scripts for the OpenSecurity addon to OpenComputers
