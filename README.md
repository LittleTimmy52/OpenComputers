## What I have
### ServerFS
This will be my own file system over a server program.

### NetworkRelay
This relays wireless messages over long distannces via linked cards. The 2 relay computers need a linked and wireless network card, 
the computer takes wireless messages, serializes the data, sends it over the linked card to the other which then broadcasts it over
the wireless card. 

wireless message <-> linked message <-> linked message <-> wireless message

### Address to file
This saves all components to a file, the other script inserts a specified component address into a specified script at the top.
