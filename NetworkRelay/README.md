# Network relay

## Purpose
This is for simply relaying wireless network data over a linked card.

## Other
I currently have this split into 2 scripts, I need to firs get it working then I need to consolidate it.
This also can only deal with broadcasted data and I need to make some way for sending, maybe some extra function to send to a computer connected to the relay, but Ill
need to figure it out later.
