# Network relay

## Purpose
This is for simply relaying wireless network data over a linked card.

wireless message --> link card --> linkcard --> wireless message and visa versa

## Other info & todo
This is spit into 2, but it works, all I need to do is make it into 1 script and make sending to a specific computer work, if possible.
